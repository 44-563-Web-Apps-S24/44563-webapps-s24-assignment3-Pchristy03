            My Favorite song at the moment is "Please Forgive Me" by Bryan Adams. 
            It was released in 1993 in his "So Far So Good" album. It was actually the only single
            and bonus track in that album as well. He has since remastered the song multiple times,
            but I find the orginal version the best. This song falls into the soft rock/rock category like most of his songs. 
            I highly recommend giving Bryan Adams a listen!

            My favorite movie is called Interstellar. Its about a man who is selected to 
            travel across the universe looking for a planet that could be inhabited by humans.
            The movie is full of great paradoxes and trippy scenes where they try to describe and
            show a black hole. I highly recommend.
